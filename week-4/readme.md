# Part I: Foundations (week 4) - Sense Think Act Assignment

## Introduction

In this project, you will implement a simple Sense-Think-Act loop for a robot in a simulated environment. The robot will be equipped with sensors to perceive its surroundings, a decision-making algorithm to determine the best action based on the sensor data, and actuators to execute the chosen action.
