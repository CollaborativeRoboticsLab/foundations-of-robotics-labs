The end-effector (EE) is the last link of the manipulator and it is the part of the manipulator that interacts with the environment. The kinematics of a manipulator is the study of the relationship between the joint angles and the position and orientation of the EE.\n",

It is the number of parameters that determine the state of a physical system and is important to define the kinematic chain of a robot. In robotics, each joint provides one or more degrees of freedom, allowing the robot to move in a certain direction or rotate around a certain axis.\n",
