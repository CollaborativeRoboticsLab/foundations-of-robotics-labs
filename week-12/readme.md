# Part III: Robot Manipulation (week 12) - Kinematics for Manipulators

## Introduction

A manipulator is a mechanical system that is controlled by a set of joints. The joints are connected to each other by rigid links. The end-effector (EE) is the last link of the manipulator and it is the part of the manipulator that interacts with the environment. The kinematics of a manipulator is the study of the relationship between the joint angles and the position and orientation of the EE.
