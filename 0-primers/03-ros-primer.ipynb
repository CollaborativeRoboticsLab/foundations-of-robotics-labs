    "## What is ROS?\n",
    "\n",
    "`ROS` is a set of *software libraries and tools* that help you build robot applications. ROS is a *distributed framework* of processes (`nodes`) that work together passing information to complete robot tasks. These processes can be grouped into packages and distributed through a network of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "***ROS Reinvents the wheel so you don't have to!***\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions to `simplify` creating complex and robust robot behavior for any robot. ROS provides a *client library* that helps write programs in a variety of `programming` languages. ROS also provides a set of tools that enable you to easily create, manage, and visualize the data flowing between programs. ROS is completely **open source** (BSD) and free to use, change, and commercialize upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS is designed to be as platform-independent as possible. ROS is not an operating system in the traditional sense of process management and scheduling; rather, you can think of ROS as a meta-operating system that provides services on top of an existing operating system. ROS is similar to *'robot frameworks'* such as Player, YARP, Orocos, CARMEN, Orca, MOOS, and Microsoft Robotics Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ROS wiki contains a more detailed [introduction](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Introduction) to ROS.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ROS2` is the latest version of ROS, which includes improvements in performance, security, and support for real-time systems. In these labs, we will be using ROS2."

    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Nodes** | A `node` is an executable that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes. |\n",
    "| **Topics** | A `topic` is a named bus over which nodes exchange messages. Topics have anonymous publish/subscribe semantics, which decouples the production of information from its consumption. Nodes that are interested in data subscribe to the relevant topic; nodes that generate data publish to the relevant topic. There can be multiple publishers and subscribers to a topic. |\n",
    "| **Messages** | `Messages` are the payload of information that is sent and received via topics. Standard primitive types (integer, floating point, boolean, etc.) are supported, as are arrays of primitives. Messages can include nested types. |\n",
    "| **Services** | A `service` is like a topic but it is transactional. When a service is requested there is a response. Then the services is complete. |\n",
    "| **Actions** | An `action` is a special type of communication pattern for robotics combining a service and a topic. Actions are useful for goal(service) oriented tasks that may take a long time to complete, and for which feedback(topic) is useful. |\n",
    "| **Parameters** | A `parameter` is a piece of information that might be important to many nodes. It can be set globally and read by any node, which helps keep track of the state of the system. |"
