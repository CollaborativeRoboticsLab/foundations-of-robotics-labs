    "In computer science, a `terminal` is a program that allows the user to access the computer's command-line interface (CLI). Using a terminal, the user can run programs on a computer without a graphical user interface (GUI). An example of a terminal program is the *Windows Command Prompt*, which provides access to the Windows CLI. Another example is the **Bash** shell, which is the default terminal program on most Linux distributions.\n",

Its primary function is to read commands that are typed into a console (i.e., an all-text display mode) or terminal window (an all-text window) and then execute (i.e., run) them. The shell's main job is to start other programs.\n",

The file system is responsible for managing the storage of files and directories on a computer's hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD).\n",
