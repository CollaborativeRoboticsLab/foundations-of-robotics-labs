It is a very popular algorithm because it is very fast and it is guaranteed to find the shortest path if one exists. The algorithm works by searching the map for the goal point. It starts at the start point and then looks at all the points around it. It then looks at all the points around those points and so on. It keeps track of the distance from the start point to each point and the distance from each point to the goal point. It then chooses the point that is closest to the goal point and repeats the process. It keeps doing this until it finds the goal point. It then works backwards from the goal point to the start point to find the shortest path."
