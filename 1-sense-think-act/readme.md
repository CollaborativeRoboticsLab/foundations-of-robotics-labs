# Project 1 - Sense Think Act

## Introduction

Sense Think Act is a common paradigm in robotics. It is a way to think about the different components of a robot. The robot senses the environment, thinks about what to do and then acts on the environment. This project is designed to get you familiar with designing and implementing a Sense Think Act system.
